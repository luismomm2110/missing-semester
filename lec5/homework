From what we have seen, we can use some ps aux | grep commands to get our jobs’ pids and then kill them, but there are better ways to do it. Start a sleep 10000 job in a terminal, background it with Ctrl-Z and continue its execution with bg. Now use pgrep to find its pid and pkill to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the -af flags).

pkill -f "sleep" 

Say you don’t want to start a process until another completes. How would you go about it? In this exercise, our limiting process will always be sleep 60 &. One way to achieve this is to use the wait command. Try launching the sleep command and having an ls wait until the background process finishes.
